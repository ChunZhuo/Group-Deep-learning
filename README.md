Equivariance, group theory for deep learning

**Group theory**
A representation $\mathrm{\rho}: G \to GL(V) $ 
GL(V) general linear group

$\mathrm{\rho}(g)$ is a linear transformation that is parameterized by group elements $g\in G$

$$\mathrm{\rho}(g')\mathrm{\rho}(g)[v]= \mathrm{\rho}(g'g)[v]$$

**Left-regular representation**
$$\mathscr{L}$$
